## About Me

I recently finished school and I am working toward my first role as a **Data Analyst** or **BI Analyst**.

I have experience troubleshooting failing ETL processes and working with the Microsoft BI stack, including **SSIS, SSRS, and SSAS**. I have built and worked with **data cubes**, and I create BI reports using **Microsoft Report Builder**. I also build dashboards in **Tableau** and use **Excel and Smartsheet** for tracking and analysis, including PivotTables.

I am still learning **Power BI** and improving my skills with data modeling and DAX.

My programming experience includes **Python, C#, and C++**, and I use **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and reporting workflows.
